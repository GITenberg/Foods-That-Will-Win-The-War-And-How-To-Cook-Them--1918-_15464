    <h3>FOREWORD</h3>

    <p>Food will win the war, and the nation whose food resources
    are best conserved will be the victor. This is the truth that
    our government is trying to drive home to every man, woman and
    child in America. We have always been happy in the fact that
    ours was the richest nation in the world, possessing unlimited
    supplies of food, fuel, energy and ability; but rich as these
    resources are they will not meet the present food shortage
    unless every family and every individual enthusiastically
    co-operates in the national saving campaign as outlined by the
    United States Food Administration.</p>

    <p>The regulations prescribed for this saving campaign are
    simple and easy of application. Our government does not ask us
    to give up three square meals a day&mdash;nor even one. All it
    asks is that we substitute as far as possible corn and other
    cereals for wheat, reduce a little our meat consumption and
    save sugar and fats by careful utilization of these
    products.</p>

    <p>There are few housekeepers who are not eager to help in this
    saving campaign, and there are few indeed who do not feel the
    need of conserving family resources. But just how is sometimes
    a difficult task.</p>

    <p>This book is planned to solve the housekeeper's problem. It
    shows how to substitute cereals and other grains for wheat, how
    to cut down the meat bill by the use of meat extension and meat
    substitute dishes which supply equivalent nutrition at much
    less cost; it shows the use of syrup and other products that
    save sugar, and it explains
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> how to utilize all kinds of
       fats. It contains 47 recipes for the making of war breads;
       64 recipes on low-cost meat dishes and meat substitutes; 54
       recipes for sugarless desserts; menus for meatless and
       wheatless days, methods of purchasing&mdash;in all some two
       hundred ways of meeting present food conditions at minimum
       cost and without the sacrifice of nutrition.</p>

    <p>Not only have its authors planned to help the woman in the
    home, conserve the family income, but to encourage those saving
    habits which must be acquired by this nation if we are to
    secure a permanent peace that will insure the world against
    another onslaught by the Prussian military powers.</p>

    <p>A little bit of saving in food means a tremendous aggregate
    total, when 100,000,000 people are doing the saving. One
    wheatless meal a day would not mean hardship; there are always
    corn and other products to be used. Yet one wheatless meal a
    day in every family would mean a saving of 90,000,000 bushels
    of wheat, which totals 5,400,000,000 lbs. Two meatless days a
    week would mean a saving of 2,200,000 lbs. of meat per annum.
    One teaspoonful of sugar per person saved each day would insure
    a supply ample to take care of our soldiers and our Allies.
    These quantities mean but a small individual sacrifice, but
    when multiplied by our vast population they will immeasurably
    aid and encourage the men who are giving their lives to the
    noble cause of humanity on which our nation has embarked.</p>

    <p>All the recipes in this book have been prepared and used in
    The School of Modern Cookery conducted by <i>The Forecast
    Magazine</i> and have been endorsed by the U.S. Food
    Administration. They have been worked out under the direction
    of Grace E. Frysinger, graduate in Domestic Science of Drexel
    Institute, of Philadelphia, and the University of Chicago. Miss
    Frysinger, who has had nine years' experience as a teacher of
    Domestic Science, has earnestly used her skill to make these
    recipes practical for home use, and at the same time accurate
    and scientific.</p>

    <p>The above illustration shows a class at the School of Modern
    Cookery. These classes are entirely free, the instruction being
    given in the interest of household economics. The foods cooked
    during the demonstration are sampled by the students and in
    this way it is possible to get in close touch with the needs of
    the homemakers and the tastes of the average
    family.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"

    <h2>SAVE WHEAT</h2>

    <h4><i>Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Wheat, with
    Practical Recipes for the Use of Other Grains</i></h4>

    <p>A slice of bread seems an unimportant thing. Yet one
    good-sized slice of bread weighs an ounce. It contains almost
    three-fourths of an ounce of flour.</p>

    <p>If every one of the country's 20,000,000 homes wastes on the
    average only one such slice of bread a day, the country is
    throwing away daily over 14,000,000 ounces of flour&mdash;over
    875,000 pounds, or enough flour for over a million one-pound
    loaves a day. For a full year at this rate there would be a
    waste of over 319,000,000 pounds of flour&mdash;1,500,000
    barrels&mdash;enough flour to make 365,000,000 loaves.</p>

    <p>As it takes four and one-half bushels of wheat to make a
    barrel of ordinary flour, this waste would represent the flour
    from over 7,000,000 bushels of wheat. Fourteen and nine-tenths
    bushels of wheat on the average are raised per acre. It would
    take the product of some 470,000 acres just to provide a single
    slice of bread to be wasted daily in every
    home.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

    <p>But some one says, "a full slice of bread is not wasted in
    every home." Very well, make it a daily slice for every four or
    every ten or every thirty homes&mdash;make it a weekly or
    monthly slice in every home&mdash;or make the wasted slice
    thinner. The waste of flour involved is still appalling. These
    are figures compiled by government experts, and they should
    give pause to every housekeeper who permits a slice of bread to
    be wasted in her home.</p>

    <p>Another source of waste of which few of us take account is
    home-made bread. Sixty per cent. of the bread used in America
    is made in the home. When one stops to consider how much
    home-made bread is poorly made, and represents a large waste of
    flour, yeast and fuel, this housewifely energy is not so
    commendable. The bread flour used in the home is also in the
    main wheat flour, and all waste of wheat at the present time
    increases the shortage of this most necessary food.</p>

    <p>Fuel, too, is a serious national problem, and all coal used
    in either range, gas, or electric oven for the baking of poor
    bread is an actual national loss. There must be no waste in
    poor baking or from poor care after the bread is made, or from
    the waste of a crust or crumb.</p>

    <p>Waste in your kitchen means starvation in some other kitchen
    across the sea. Our Allies are asking for 450,000,000 bushels
    of wheat, and we are told that even then theirs will be a
    privation loaf. Crop shortage and unusual demand has left
    Canada and the United States, which are the largest sources of
    wheat, with but 300,000,000 bushels available for export. The
    deficit must be met by reducing consumption on this side the
    Atlantic. This can be done by eliminating waste and by making
    use of cereals and flours other than wheat in bread-making.</p>

    <p>The wide use of wheat flour for bread-making has been due to
    custom. In Europe rye and oats form the staple breads of many
    countries, and in some sections of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> South corn-bread is the staff
       of life. We have only to modify a little our bread-eating
       habits in order to meet the present need. Other cereals can
       well be used to eke out the wheat, but they require slightly
       different handling.</p>

    <p>In making yeast breads, the essential ingredient is gluten,
    which is extended by carbon dioxide gas formed by yeast growth.
    With the exception of rye, grains other than wheat do not
    contain sufficient gluten for yeast bread, and it is necessary
    to use a wheat in varying proportions in order to supply the
    deficient gluten. Even the baker's rye loaf is usually made of
    one-half rye and one-half wheat. This is the safest proportion
    for home use in order to secure a good texture.</p>

    <p>When oatmeal is used, it is necessary to scald the oatmeal
    to prevent a raw taste. Oatmeal also makes a softer dough than
    wheat, and it is best to make the loaf smaller and bake it
    longer: about one hour instead of the forty-five minutes which
    we allow for wheat bread.</p>

    <p>The addition of one-third barley flour to wheat flour makes
    a light colored, good flavored bread. If a larger proportion
    than this is used, the loaf has a decided barley flavor. If you
    like this flavor and increase the proportion of barley, be sure
    to allow the dough a little longer time to rise, as by
    increasing the barley you weaken the gluten content of your
    loaf.</p>

    <p>Rice and cornmeal can be added to wheat breads in a 10 per
    cent. proportion. Laboratory tests have shown that any greater
    proportion than this produces a heavy, small loaf.</p>

    <p>Potato flour or mashed potato can be used to extend the
    wheat, it being possible to work in almost 50 per cent. of
    potato, but this makes a darker and moister loaf than when
    wheat alone is used. In order to take care of this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> moisture, it is best to
       reserve part of the wheat for the second kneading.</p>

    <p>Graham and entire wheat flour also effect a saving of wheat
    because a larger percentage of the wheat berry is used. Graham
    flour is the whole kernel of wheat, ground. Entire wheat flour
    is the flour resulting from the grinding of all but the outer
    layer of wheat. A larger use of these coarser flours will
    therefore help materially in eking out our scant wheat supply
    as the percentage of the wheat berry used for bread flour is
    but 72 per cent. Breads made from these coarser flours also aid
    digestion and are a valuable addition to the dietary.</p>

    <p>In order to keep down waste by eliminating the poor batch of
    bread, it is necessary to understand the principles of
    bread-making. Fermentation is the basic principle of yeast
    bread, and fermentation is controlled by temperature. The yeast
    plant grows at a temperature from 70 to 90 degrees
    (Fahrenheit), and if care is taken to maintain this temperature
    during the process of fermentation, waste caused by sour dough
    or over-fermentation will be eliminated. When we control the
    temperature we can also reduce the time necessary for making a
    loaf of bread, or several loaves of bread as may be needed,
    into as short a period as three hours. This is what is known as
    the quick method. It not only saves time and labor, but,
    controlling the temperature, insures accurate results. The
    easiest way to control the temperature is to put the bowl
    containing the dough into another of slightly larger size
    containing water at a temperature of 90 degrees. The water of
    course should never be hot. Hot water kills the yeast plant.
    Cold water checks its growth. Cover the bowl and set it in the
    gas oven or fireless cooker or on the shelf of the coal range.
    As the water in the large bowl cools off, remove a cupful and
    add a cupful of hot water. At the end of one and one-half hours
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> dough should have doubled in
       bulk. Take it out of the pan and knead until the large gas
       bubbles are broken (about ten minutes). Then place in
       greased bread pans and allow to rise for another half hour.
       At the end of this time it will not only fill the pan, but
       will project out of it. Do not allow the dough to rise too
       high, for then the bread will have large holes in it. A good
       proportion as a general rule to follow, is:</p>

        <p>In this recipe sugar has been omitted because of the
        serious shortage, but after the war a teaspoon of sugar

        quantity, may also be omitted.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These materials make a loaf of about one pound, which should
    be baked in forty to fifty minutes at a temperature of 450
    degrees (Fahrenheit). Allow a little longer time for bread
    containing oatmeal or other grains. Such breads require a
    little longer baking and a little lower temperature than wheat
    breads. If you do not use a thermometer in testing your oven,
    place a piece of paper on the center shelf, and if it browns in
    two minutes your oven is right. If a longer period for raising
    is allowed than is suggested in the above recipe, the yeast
    proportion should be decreased. For overnight bread use
    one-quarter yeast cake per loaf; for six-hour bread, use
    one-half yeast cake per loaf; for three-hour bread, use one
    yeast cake per loaf. In baking, the time allowed should depend
    on the size of the loaf. When baked at a temperature of 450
    degrees, large loaves take from forty-five to sixty minutes,
    small loaves from thirty to forty minutes, rolls from ten to
    twenty minutes.</p>

    <p>It is well to divide the oven time into four parts. During
    the first quarter, the rising continues; second quarter,
    browning begins; the third quarter, browning is finished;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> the fourth quarter, bread
       shrinks from the side of the pan. These are always safe
       tests to follow in your baking. When baked, the bread should
       be turned out of the pans and allow to cool on a wire rack.
       When cool, put the bread in a stone crock or bread box. To
       prevent staleness, keep the old bread away from the
       fresh&mdash;scald the bread crock or give your bread box a
       sun bath at frequent intervals.</p>

    <p>Even with all possible care to prevent waste, yeast breads
    will not conserve our wheat supply so well as quick breads,
    because all yeast breads need a larger percentage of wheat. The
    home baker can better serve her country by introducing into her
    menus numerous quick breads that can be made from cornmeal,
    rye, corn and rye, hominy, and buckwheat. Griddle cakes and
    waffles can also be made from lentils, soy beans, potatoes,
    rice and peas.</p>

    <p>Do not expect that the use of other cereals in bread-making
    will reduce the cost of your bread. That is not the object.
    Saving of wheat for war needs is the thing we are striving for,
    and this is as much an act of loyalty as buying Liberty Bonds.
    It is to meet the crucial world need of bread that we are
    learning to substitute, and not to spare the national
    purse.</p>

    <p>Besides this saving of wheat, our Government also asks us to
    omit all fat from our yeast breads in order to conserve the
    diminishing fat supply. This may seem impossible to the woman
    who has never made bread without shortening, but recent
    experiments in bread-making laboratories have proved that
    bread, without shortening, is just as light and as good in
    texture as that made with shortening&mdash;the only difference
    being a slight change in flavor. These experiments have also
    shown that it is possible to supply shortening by the
    introduction of 3 per cent. to 5 per cent. of canned cocoanut
    or of peanut butter, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> and that sugar may also be
       omitted from bread-making recipes. In fact, the war is
       bringing about manifold interesting experiments which prove
       that edible and nutritious bread can be made of many things
       besides the usual white flour.</p>

    <p>The recipes herewith appended, showing the use of
    combinations of cereals and wheat, have been carefully tested
    in The Forecast School of Modern Cookery. Good bread can be
    made from each recipe, and the new flavors obtained by the use
    of other grains make a pleasing and wholesome variety.</p>

    <p>A family which has eaten oatmeal or entire wheat bread will
    never again be satisfied with a diet that includes only bread
    made from bleached flour. Children, especially, will be
    benefited by the change, as the breads made from coarser flours
    are not only more nutritious, but are rich in the minerals and
    vitamine elements that are so essential to the growth of strong
    teeth, bones and growing tissues.</p>

    <p>The homemaker, too, will never regret her larger
    acquaintance with bread-making materials, as the greater
    variety of breads that she will find herself able to produce
    will be a source of pleasure and keen satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>SAVE MEAT</h2>

    <h4><i>Reasons Why Our Government Has Asked Us to Save Meat
    with Practical Recipes for Meat Conservation</i></h4>

    <p>As a nation we eat and waste 80 per cent. more meat than we
    require to maintain health. This statement, recently issued by
    the United States Food Administration, is appalling when we
    consider that there is a greater demand for meat in the world
    to-day than ever before, coupled with a greatly decreased
    production. The increase in the demand for meat and animal
    products is due to the stress of the war. Millions of men are
    on the fighting line doing hard physical labor, and require a
    larger food allowance than when they were civilians. To meet
    the demand for meat and to save their grains, our Allies have
    been compelled to kill upward of thirty-three million head of
    their stock animals, and they have thus stifled their animal
    production. This was burning the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> candle at both ends, and they
       now face increased demand handicapped by decreased
       production.</p>

    <p>America must fill the breach. Not only must we meet the
    present increased demand, but we must be prepared as the war
    advances to meet an even greater demand for this most necessary
    food. The way out of this serious situation is first to reduce
    meat consumption to the amount really needed and then to learn
    to use other foods that will supply the food element which is
    found in meat. This element is called protein, and we depend
    upon it to build and repair body tissues.</p>

    <p>Although most persons believe that protein can only be
    obtained from meat, it is found in many other foods, such as
    milk, skim milk, cheese, cottage cheese, poultry, eggs, fish,
    dried peas, beans, cow peas, lentils and nuts. For instance,
    pound for pound, salmon, either fresh or canned, equals round
    steak in protein content; cream cheese contains one-quarter
    more protein and three times as much fat; peanuts (hulled)
    one-quarter more protein and three and a half times as much
    fat; beans (dried) a little more protein and one-fifth as much
    fat; eggs (one dozen) about the same in protein and one-half
    more fat. It is our manifest duty to learn how to make the best
    use of these foods in order to save beef, pork and mutton, to
    be shipped across the sea. This means that the housekeeper has
    before her the task of training the family palate to accept new
    food preparations. Training the family palate is not easy,
    because bodies that have grown accustomed to certain food
    combinations find it difficult to get along without them, and
    rebel at a change. If these habits of diet are suddenly
    disturbed we may upset digestion, as well as create a feeling
    of dissatisfaction which is equally harmful to physical
    well-being. The wise housekeeper will therefore make her
    changes gradually.</p>

       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> used to having meat twice a
       day, it will be well to start out with meat once a day and
       keep up this régime for a couple of weeks. Then drop meat
       for a whole day, supplying in its stead a meat substitute
       dish that will furnish the same nutriment. After a while you
       can use meat substitutes at least twice a week without
       disturbing the family's mental or physical equilibrium. It
       would be well also to introduce dishes that extend the meat
       flavor, such as stews combined with dumplings, hominy, or
       rice; pot pies or short cakes with a dressing of meat and
       vegetables; meat loaf, souffle or croquettes in which meat
       is combined with bread crumbs, potato or rice.</p>

    <p>Meat eating is largely a matter of flavor. If flavor is
    supplied, the reduction of meat in the diet can be made with
    little annoyance. Nutrition can always be supplied in the other
    dishes that accompany the meal, as a certain proportion of
    protein is found in almost every food product. The meat that we
    use to obtain flavor in sauces and gravies need not be large in
    quantity, nor expensive in cut. The poor or cheap cuts have
    generally more flavor than the expensive ones, the difference
    being entirely in texture and tenderness, freedom from gristle
    and inedible tissue. There are many cereals, such as rice,
    hominy, cornmeal, samp and many vegetable dishes, especially
    dried beans of all kinds, that are greatly improved by the
    addition of meat sauce and when prepared in this way may be
    served as the main dish of a meal.</p>

    <p>Dr. Harvey W. Wiley has stated that the meat eating of the
    future will not be regarded as a necessity so much as it has
    been in the past, and that meat will be used more as a
    condimental substance. Europe has for years used meat for
    flavor rather than for nutriment. It would seem that the time
    has come for Americans to learn the use of meat for flavor and
    to utilize more skillfully the protein of other
    foods.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>

    <p>It may be difficult to convince the meat lover that he can
    radically reduce the proportion of meat in his diet without
    detriment to health. Many persons adhere to the notion that you
    are not nourished unless you eat meat; that meat foods are
    absolutely necessary to maintain the body strength. This idea
    is entirely without foundation, for the foods mentioned as meat
    substitutes earlier in this chapter can be made to feed the
    world, and feed it well&mdash;in fact, no nation uses so large
    a proportion of meat as America.</p>

    <p>The first step, therefore, in preparing ourselves to reduce
    meat consumption is to recognize that only a small quantity of
    meat is necessary to supply sufficient protein for adult life.
    The growing child or the youth springing into manhood needs a
    larger percentage of meat than the adult, and in apportioning
    the family's meat ration this fact should not be
    overlooked.</p>

    <p>The second step is to reduce the amount purchased, choosing
    cuts that contain the least waste, and by utilizing with care
    that which we do purchase. Fat, trimmings, and bones all have
    their uses and should be saved from the garbage pail.</p>

    <p>Careful buying, of course, depends on a knowledge of cuts, a
    study of the percentage of waste in each cut, and the food
    value of the different kinds of meat. Make a study of the
    different cuts, as shown in the charts on pages 36, 37, and
    armed with this knowledge go forth to the butcher for practical
    buying.</p>

    <p>Then comes the cooking, which can only be properly done when
    the fundamental principles of the cooking processes, such as
    boiling, braising, broiling, stewing, roasting and frying are
    understood. Each cut requires different handling to secure the
    maximum amount of nutriment and flavor. The waste occasioned by
    improper cooking is a large factor in both household and
    national economy.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>

    <p>It has been estimated that a waste of an ounce each day of
    edible meat or fat in the twenty million American homes amounts
    to 456,000,000 pounds of valuable animal food a year. At
    average dressed weights, this amounts to 875,000 steers, or
    over 3,000,000 hogs. Each housekeeper, therefore, who saves her
    ounce a day aids in this enormous saving, which will mean so
    much in the feeding of our men on the fighting line.</p>

    <p>So the housekeeper who goes to her task of training the
    family palate to accept meat substitutes and meat economy
    dishes, who revolutionizes her methods of cooking so as to
    utilize even "the pig's squeak," will be doing her bit toward
    making the world safe for democracy.</p>

    <p>The following charts, tables of nutritive values and
    suggested menus have been arranged to help her do this work.
    The American woman has her share in this great world struggle,
    and that is the intelligent conservation of food.</p>

    <h4>SELECTION OF MEAT</h4>

    <p>BEEF&mdash;Dull red as cut, brighter after exposure to air;
    lean, well mottled with fat; flesh, firm; fat, yellowish in
    color. Best beef from animal 3 to 5 years old, weighing 900 to
    1,200 pounds. Do not buy wet, soft, or pink beef.</p>

    <p>VEAL&mdash;Flesh pink. (If white, calf was bled before
    killed or animal too young.) The fat should be white.</p>

    <p>MUTTON&mdash;Best from animal 3 years old. Flesh dull red,
    fat firm and white.</p>

    <p>LAMB&mdash;(Spring Lamb 3 months to 6 months old; season,
    February to March.) Bones of lamb should be small; end of bone
    in leg of lamb should be serrated; flesh pink, and fat
    white.</p>

    <p>PORK&mdash;The lean should be fine grained and pale pink.
    The skin should be smooth and clear. If flesh is soft, or fat
    yellowish, pork is not
    good.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>

    <h4>SELECTION OF TOUGHER CUTS AND THEIR USES</h4>

    <p>Less expensive cuts of meat have more nourishment than the
    more expensive, and if properly cooked and seasoned, have as
    much tenderness. Tough cuts, as chuck or top sirloin, may be
    boned and rolled and then roasted by the same method as tender
    cuts, the only difference will be that the tougher cuts require
    longer cooking. Have the bones from rolled meats sent home to
    use for soups. Corned beef may be selected from flank, naval,
    plate or brisket. These cuts are more juicy than rump or round
    cuts.</p>

    <p>1. <i>For pot roast</i> use chuck, crossrib, round,
    shoulder, rump or top sirloin.</p>

    <p>2. <i>For stew</i> use shin, shoulder, top sirloin or
    neck.</p>

    <p>3. <i>For steaks</i> use flank, round or chuck. If these
    cuts are pounded, or both pounded and rubbed with a mixture of
    1 part vinegar and 2 parts oil before cooking, they will be
    very tender.</p>

    <p>4. <i>Soups</i>&mdash;Buy shin or neck. The meat from these
    may be utilized by serving with horseradish or mustard sauce,
    or combined with equal amount of fresh meat for meat loaf,
    scalloped dish, etc.</p>

    <h4>DRY METHODS</h4>

    <p>1. <i>Roasting or Baking</i>&mdash;Oven roasting or baking
    is applied to roasts.</p>

    <p>Place the roast in a hot oven, or if gas is used, put in the
    broiling oven to sear the outside quickly, and thus keep in the
    juices. Salt, pepper and flour. If an open roasting pan is used
    place a few tablespoonfuls of fat and 1 cup of water in the
    pan, which should be used to baste the roast frequently. If a
    covered pan is used basting is unnecessary.</p>

    <h4>MOIST METHODS</h4>

    <p>1. Boiling&mdash;Cooking in boiling water&mdash;especially
    poultry, salt meats, etc.</p>

    <p>2. Steaming&mdash;A method of cooking by utilizing steam
    from boiling water, which retains more food value than any
    other. Too seldom applied to meats.</p>

    <p>3. Frying&mdash;Cooking by immersion in hot fat at
    temperature 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Used for croquettes,
    etc.</p>

    <p>If a fat thermometer is not available, test by using small
    pieces of bread. Put into heated fat:</p>

    <p>A&mdash;For croquettes made from food requiring little
    cooking, such as oysters, or from previously cooked mixtures,
    as rice, fish or meat croquettes, bread should brown in
    one-half minute.</p>

    <p>B&mdash;For mixtures requiring cooking, as doughnuts,
    fritters, etc., bread should brown in one minute.</p>

    <h4>COMBINATION METHODS</h4>

    <p>1. Pot Roasting&mdash;Cooking (by use of steam from small
    amount of water) tough cuts of meat which have been browned but
    not cooked thoroughly.</p>

    <p>Season meat. Dredge with flour. Sear in hot pan until well
    browned. Place oil rack in pot containing water to height of
    one inch, but do not let water reach the meat. Keep water
    slowly boiling. Replenish as needed with boiling water. This
    method renders tough cuts tender, but requires several hours
    cooking.</p>

    <p>2. Stewing&mdash;A combination of methods which draws part
    of flavor into gravy and retains part in pieces which are to be
    used as meat.</p>

    <p>Cut meat into pieces suitable for serving. Cover one-half of
    meat with cold water. Let stand one hour. Bring slowly to
    boiling point. Dredge other half of meat with flour and brown
    in small amount of fat. Add to the other mixture and cook
    slowly <span class="fraction"
          title="1-1/2">1½</span> to 2 hours, or until tender,
          adding diced vegetables, thickening and seasoning as
          desired one-half hour before cooking is finished.</p>

    <p>3. Fricasseeing&mdash;Cooking in a sauce until tender, meat
    which has been previously browned but not cooked
    throughout.</p>

    <p>Brown meat in small amount of fat. Place in boiling water to
    cover. Cook slowly until tender. To 1 pint of water in which
    meat is cooked, add <span class="fraction"
          title="1/4">¼</span> cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt,
          <span class="fraction"
          title="1/4">¼</span> teaspoon cayenne, and
          <span class="fraction"
          title="1/4">¼</span> cup milk, thoroughly blended. When
          at boiling point, add one beaten egg, 1 tablespoon
          chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon cold water well mixed,
          Add cooked meat and
          serve.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"

    <h3>THE ECONOMY OF MEAT AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES</h3>

    <p>Don't buy more than your family actually needs. Study and
    know what the actual needs are, and you will not make
    unnecessary expenditures.</p>

    <p>Learn what the various cuts of meat are, what they can be
    used for, and which are best suited to the particular needs of
    your household.</p>

    <p>Study the timeliness of buying certain cuts of meats. There
    are days when prices are lower than normal.</p>

    <p>Always check the butcher's weights by watching him closely
    or by weighing the goods on scales of your own.</p>

    <p>Always buy a definite quantity. Ask what the pound rate is,
    and note any fractional part of the weight. Don't ask for "ten
    or twenty cents' worth."</p>

    <p>Select your meat or fish personally. There is no doubt that
    high retail prices are due to the tendency of many housewives
    to do their buying by telephone or through their servants.</p>

    <p>Test the freshness of meat and fish. Staleness of meat and
    fish is shown by loose and flabby flesh. The gills of fresh
    fish are red and the fins stiff.</p>

    <p>Make all the purchases possible at a public market, if you
    can walk to it, or if carfare will not make too large an
    increase in the amount you have set aside for the day's
    buying.</p>

    <p>A food chopper can be made to pay for itself in a short time
    by the great variety of ways it furnishes of utilizing
    left-overs.</p>

    <p>If possible, buy meat trimmings. They cost 20 cents a pound
    and can be used in many ways.</p>

    <p>Buy the ends of bacon strips. They are just as nutritious as
    sliced bacon and cost 50 per cent.
    less.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>

    <p>Learn to use drippings in place of butter for cooking
    purposes.</p>

    <p>Buy cracked eggs. They cost much less than whole ones and
    are usually just as good.</p>

    <p>Keep a stock pot. Drop into it all left-overs. These make an
    excellent basis for soup stock.</p>

    <p>Don't throw away the heads and bones of fish. Clean them and
    use them with vegetables for fish chowder or cream of fish
    soup.</p>

    <p>Study attractive ways of serving food. Plain, cheap, dishes
    can be made appetizing if they look attractive on the
    table.</p>

    <p>Experiment with meat substitutes. Cheese, dried vegetables
    and the cheaper varieties of fish can supply all the nutriment
    of meat at a much lower cost.</p>

    <p>Don't do your cooking "by guess." If the various ingredients
    are measured accurately, the dish will taste better and cost
    less.</p>

    <p>Don't buy delicatessen food if you can possibly avoid it.
    Delicatessen meals cost 15 per cent. more than the same meals
    cooked at home, and the food is not as nourishing. You pay for
    the cooking and the rent of the delicatessen store, as well as
    the proprietor's profit.</p>

    <p>Don't pay five or ten cents more a dozen for white eggs in
    the belief that they are superior to brown eggs. The food value
    of each is the same. The difference in shell color is due to
    the breed of hen.</p>

    <p>Tell the butcher to give you the trimmings of chicken, i.e.,
    the head, feet, fat and giblets. They make delicious chicken
    soup. The feet contain gelatine, which gives soup
    consistency.</p>

    <p>Buy a tough, and consequently less expensive, chicken and
    make it tender by steaming it for three hours before
    roasting.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>

    <p>Don't put meat wrapped in paper into the ice-box, as the
    paper tends to absorb the juices.</p>

    <p>Try to find a way to buy at least a part of your meats and
    eggs direct from the farm. You will get fresher, better food,
    and if it is sent by parcels post it can usually be delivered
    to your table for much less than city prices.</p>

    <p>Mix flour, salt and baking powder. Rub in shortening, and
    mix to dough with milk and water. Roll out to quarter of an
    inch thickness, bake in layer cake tins. Put together with the
    chopped meat mixed with the onion and seasoning, and heated hot
    with the gravy or stock. If stock is used, thicken with a
    tablespoon of flour mixed with one of butter, or butter
    substitute. Serve as soon as put together. Cold cooked fish
    heated in cream sauce may be used for a filling instead of the
    meat.</p>

    <h4>SCRAPPLE</h4>

    <p>Place a pig's head in 4 quarts of cold water and bring
    slowly to the boil. Skim carefully and season the liquid highly
    with salt, cayenne and a teaspoon of rubbed sage. Let the
    liquid simmer gently until the meat falls from the bones.
    Strain off the liquid, remove the bones, and chop the meat
    fine.</p>

    <p>Measure the liquid and allow 1 cup of sifted cornmeal to 3
    cups of liquid. Blend the cornmeal in the liquid and simmer
    until it is the consistency of thick porridge. Stir in the
    chopped meat and pour in greased baking pans to cool. One-third
    buckwheat may be used instead of cornmeal, and any kind of
    chopped meat can be blended with the pork if desired. Any type
    of savory herb can also be used, according to taste.</p>

    <p>When scrapple is to be eaten, cut into one-half inch slices,
    dredge with flour, and brown in hot fat.</p>

    <h4>FISH AS A MEAT SUBSTITUTE</h4>

    <p>As the main course at a meal, fish may be served accompanied
    by vegetables or it may be prepared as a "one-meal dish"
    requiring only bread and butter and a simple dessert to
    complete a nutritious and well balanced diet. A lack of proper
    knowledge of selection of fish for the different methods of
    cooking, and the improper cooking of fish once it is acquired,
    are responsible to a large extent for the prejudice so
    frequently to be found against the use of fish.</p>

    <p>The kinds of fish obtainable in different markets vary
    somewhat, but the greatest difficulty for many housekeepers
    seems to be, to know what fish may best be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> selected for baking,
       broiling, etc., and the tests for fish when cooked. An
       invariable rule for cooking fish is to apply high heat at
       first, until the flesh is well seared so as to retain the
       juices; then a lower temperature until the flesh is cooked
       throughout. Fish is thoroughly cooked when the flesh flakes.
       For broiling or pan broiling, roll fish in flour or
       cornmeal, preferably the latter, which has been well
       seasoned with salt and cayenne. This causes the outside to
       be crisp and also gives added flavor. Leftover bits of baked
       or other fish may be combined with white sauce or tomato
       sauce, or variations of these sauces, and served as creamed
       fish, or placed in a greased baking dish, crumbs placed on
       top and browned and served as scalloped fish. Fish canapes,
       fish cocktail, fish soup or chowder; baked, steamed, broiled
       or pan broiled fish, entrees without number, and fish salad
       give opportunity to use it in endless variety.</p>

    <p>Combined with starchy foods such as rice, hominy, macaroni,
    spaghetti or potato, and accompanied by a green vegetable or
    fruit, the dish becomes a meal. Leftover bits may also be
    utilized for salad, either alone with cooked or mayonaise salad
    dressing, or combined with vegetables such as peas, carrots,
    cucumbers, etc. The addition of a small amount of chopped
    pickle to fish salad improves its flavor, or a plain or tomato
    gelatine foundation may be used as a basis for the salad. The
    appended lists of fish suitable for the various methods of
    cooking, and the variety in the recipes for the uses of fish,
    have been arranged to encourage a wider use of this excellent
    meat substitute, so largely eaten by European epicures, but too
    seldom included in American menus. During the period of the
    war, the larger use of fish is a patriotic measure in that it
    will save the beef, mutton and pork needed for our
    armies.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"

    <h2>SAVE SUGAR</h2>

    <h4><i>Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Sugar With
    Practical Recipes for Sugarless Desserts, Cakes, Candies and
    Preserves.</i></h4>

    <p>One ounce of sugar less per person, per day, is all our
    Government asks of us to meet the world sugar shortage. One
    ounce of sugar equals two scant level tablespoonfuls and
    represents a saving that every man, woman and child should be
    able to make. Giving up soft drinks and the frosting on our
    cakes, the use of sugarless desserts and confections, careful
    measuring and thorough stirring of that which we place in our
    cups of tea and coffee, and the use of syrup, molasses or honey
    on our pancakes and fritters will more than effect this
    saving.</p>

    <p>It seems but a small sacrifice, if sacrifice it can be
    called, when one recognizes that cutting down sugar
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> consumption will be most
       beneficial to national health. The United States is the
       largest consumer of sugar in the world. In 1916 Germany's
       consumption was 20 lbs. per person per year, Italy's 29 to
       30 lbs., that of France 37, of England 40, while the United
       States averaged 85 lbs. This enormous consumption is due to
       the fact that we are a nation of candy-eaters. We spend
       annually $80,000,000 on confections. These are usually eaten
       between meals, causing digestive disturbances as well as
       unwarranted expense. Sweets are a food and should be eaten
       at the close of the meal, and if this custom is established
       during the war, not only will tons of sugar be available for
       our Allies, but the health of the nation improved.</p>

    <p>The average daily consumption of sugar per person in this
    country is 5 ounces, and yet nutritional experts agree that not
    more than 3 ounces a day should be taken. The giving up of one
    ounce per day will, therefore, be of great value in reducing
    many prevalent American ailments. Flatulent dyspepsia,
    rheumatism, diabetes, and stomach acidity are only too
    frequently traced to an oversupply of sugar in our daily
    diet.</p>

    <p>Most persons apparently think of sugar merely as a
    sweetening agent, forgetting entirely the fact that it is a
    most concentrated food. It belongs to what is called the
    carbohydrate group, upon which we largely depend for energy and
    heat. It is especially valuable to the person doing active
    physical work, the open-air worker, or the healthy, active,
    growing child, but should be used sparingly by other classes of
    people. Sugar is not only the most concentrated fuel food in
    the dietary, but it is one that is very readily utilized in the
    body, 98 per cent. of it being available for absorption, while
    within thirty minutes of the time it is taken into the system
    part of it is available for energy.</p>

    <p>As a food it must be supplied, especially to the classes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> of people mentioned above,
       but as a confection it can well be curtailed. When it is
       difficult to obtain, housekeepers must avail themselves of
       changed recipes and different combinations to supply the
       necessary three ounces per day and to gain the much-desired
       sweet taste so necessary to many of our foods of neutral
       flavor with which sugar is usually combined.</p>

    <p>Our grandmothers knew how to prepare many dishes without
    sugar. In their day lack of transportation facilities, of
    refining methods and various economic factors made molasses,
    sorghum, honey, etc., the only common methods of sweetening.
    But the housekeeper of to-day knows little of sweetening
    mediums except sugar, and sugar shortage is to her a crucial
    problem. There are many ways, however, of getting around sugar
    shortage and many methods of supplying the necessary food value
    and sweetening.</p>

    <p>By the use of marmalades, jams and jellies canned during the
    season when the sugar supply was less limited, necessity for
    the use of sugar can be vastly reduced. By the addition to
    desserts and cereals of dried fruits, raisins, dates, prunes
    and figs, which contain large amounts of natural sugar, the
    sugar consumption can be greatly lessened. By utilizing
    leftover syrup from canned or preserved fruits for sweetening
    other fruits, and by the use of honey, molasses, maple sugar,
    maple syrup and corn syrup, large quantities of sugar may be
    saved. The substitution of sweetened condensed milk for dairy
    milk in tea, coffee and cocoa&mdash;in fact, in all our cooking
    processes where milk is required&mdash;will also immeasurably
    aid in sugar conservation. The substitutes mentioned are all
    available in large amounts. Honey is especially valuable for
    children, as it consists of the more simple sugars which are
    less irritating than cane sugar, and there is no danger of acid
    stomach from the amounts generally
    consumed.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>

    <p>As desserts are the chief factor in the use of quantities of
    sugar in our diet, the appended recipes will be of value, as
    they deal with varied forms of nutritious, attractive sugarless
    desserts. It is only by the one-ounce savings of each
    individual member of our great one hundred million population
    that the world sugar shortage may be met, and it is hoped every
    housekeeper will study her own time-tested recipes with the
    view of utilizing as far as possible other forms of sweetening.
    In most recipes the liquid should be slightly reduced in amount
    and about one-fifth more of the substitute should be used than
    the amount of sugar called for.</p>

    <p>With a few tests along this line one will be surprised how
    readily the substitution may be made. If all sweetening agents
    become scarce, desserts can well be abandoned. Served at the
    end of a full meal, desserts are excess food except in the diet
    of children, where they should form a component part of the
    meal.</p>

    <h4>PEANUT BRITTLE</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>1 cup corn syrup</p>

            <p>1 tablespoon fat</p>

    <p>Boil syrup and fat until brittle when tested in cold water.
    Grease a pan, sprinkle the roasted and shelled peanuts in it,
    making an even distribution, then turn in the syrup. When
    almost cold mark into squares. Cocoanut, puffed wheat or puffed
    rice may be used for candy instead of peanuts.</p>

    <h4>RAISIN AND PEANUT LOAF</h4>

    <p>Put equal quantity of seeded raisins and roasted peanuts
    through the food chopper, using the coarsest blade. Moisten
    with molasses just enough so that the mixture can be molded
    into a loaf. Chill, cut and serve as candy. Chopped English
    walnuts combined with chopped dates or figs make a very

    <h2>SAVE FAT</h2>

    <h4><i>Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Fat, With
    Practical Recipes for Fat Conservation</i></h4>

    <p>With the world-wide decrease of animal production, animal
    fats are now growing so scarce that the world is being scoured
    for new sources of supply. Our Government has asked the
    housewife to conserve all the fats that come to her home and
    utilize them to the best advantage. To this end it is necessary
    to have some knowledge of the character of different fats and
    the purposes to which they are best adapted.</p>

    <p>The word fat usually brings to one's mind an unappetizing
    chunk of meat fat which most persons cannot and will not eat,
    and fatty foods have been popularly supposed to be "bad for us"
    and "hard to digest." Fats are, however, an important food
    absolutely essential to complete nutrition, which repay us
    better for the labor <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> of digestion than any other
       food. If they are indigestible, it is usually due to
       improper cooking or improper use; if they are expensive, it
       is merely because they are extravagantly handled. The chief
       function of fatty food is to repair and renew the fatty
       tissues, to yield energy and to maintain the body heat. The
       presence of fat in food promotes the flow of the pancreatic
       juice and bile, which help in the assimilation of other
       foods and assist the excretory functions of the intestine.
       These are badly performed if bile and other digestive fluids
       are not secreted in sufficient quantity. The absence of fat
       in the diet leads to a state of malnutrition, predisposing
       to tuberculosis, especially in children and young
       persons.</p>

    <p>It is claimed that the most serious food shortage in Germany
    is fat; that the civilian population is dying in large numbers
    because of the lack of it, and that Von Hindenburg's men will
    lose out on the basis of fat, rather than on the basis of
    munitions or military organization. Worst of all is the effect
    of fat shortage on the children of the nation. Leaders of
    thought all over Europe assert that even if Germany wins,
    Germany has lost, because it has sapped the strength of its
    coming generation.</p>

    <p>The term fat is used to designate all products of fatty
    composition and includes liquid fats such as oils, soft fats
    such as butter, and hard fats such as tallow. While all fats
    have practically the same energy-value, they differ widely from
    each other in their melting point, and the difference in
    digestibility seems to correspond to the difference in melting
    point. Butter burns at 240 degrees Fahrenheit, while vegetable
    oils can be heated as high as 600 degrees Fahrenheit,
    furnishing a very high temperature for cooking purposes before
    they begin to burn. The scorching of fat not only wastes the
    product, but renders it indigestible, even dangerous to some
    people, and for this reason butter should never be used for
    frying, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> frying temperature is usually
       higher than 240 degrees. It is well to choose for cooking
       only those fats which have the highest heat-resisting
       qualities because they do not burn so easily.</p>

    <p>Beginning with the lowest burning point, fats include
    genuine butter, substitute butters, lard and its substitutes,
    and end with tallow and vegetable oils. Of the latter, there is
    a varied selection from the expensive olive oil to the cheaper
    cottonseed, peanut, cocoanut and corn oils and their compounds
    and the hydrogenated oils.</p>

    <p>The economy of fat, therefore, depends on the choice of the
    fat used for the various cooking processes as well as the
    conservation of all fatty residue, such as crackling, leftover
    frying fats and soup fat. For cooking processes, such as
    sauteing (pan frying), or deep fat frying, it is best to use
    the vegetable and nut oils. These are more plentiful, and hence
    cheaper than the animal fats; the latter, however, can be
    produced in the home from the fats of meats and leftover pan
    fats, which should not be overlooked as frying mediums. Butter
    and butter substitutes are best kept for table use and for
    flavoring. The hydrogenated oils, home-rendered fats, lard and
    beef and mutton suet can be used for shortening fats.</p>

    <p>In the purchase of meats, the careful housewife should see
    that the butcher gives her all the fat she pays for, as all
    fats can be rendered very easily at home and can be used for
    cooking purposes. Butchers usually leave as large a proportion
    of fat as possible on all cuts of meat which, when paid for at
    meat prices, are quite an expensive item. All good clear fat
    should, therefore, be carefully trimmed from meats before
    cooking. Few people either like or find digestible greasy, fat
    meats, and the fat paid for at meat prices, which could have
    been rendered and used for cooking, is wasted when sent to
    table.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>

    <p>There are various methods of conserving fat. First, the
    economical use of table fats; second, the saving of cooking;
    and third, the proper use of all types of fat.</p>

    <p>Economy in the use of table fats may best be secured by
    careful serving. One serving of butter is a little
    thing&mdash;there are about sixty-four of them in a pound. In
    many households the butter left on the plates probably would
    equal a serving or one-fourth of an ounce, daily, which is
    usually scraped into the garbage pail or washed off in the
    dishpan. But if everyone of our 20,000,000 households should
    waste one-fourth of an ounce of butter daily, it would mean
    312,500 pounds a day, or 114,062,500 pounds a year. To make
    this butter would take 265,261,560 gallons of milk, or the
    product of over a half-million cows, an item in national
    economy which should not be overlooked.</p>

    <p>When butter is used to flavor cooked vegetables, it is more
    economical to add it just before they are served rather than
    while they are cooking. The flavor thus imparted is more
    pronounced, and, moreover, if the butter is added before
    cooking, much of it will be lost in the water unless the latter
    is served with the vegetables. Butter substitutes, such as
    oleomargarine and nut margarine, should be more largely used
    for the table, especially for adults. Conserve butter for
    children, as animal fats contain vitamines necessary for
    growing tissues. Butter substitutes are as digestible and as
    nourishing as butter, and have a higher melting point. They
    keep better and cost less.</p>

    <p>Oleomargarine, which has been in existence for fifty years,
    was first offered to the world in 1870 by a famous French
    chemist, Mege-Mouries, who was in search of a butter substitute
    cheap enough to supply the masses with the much-needed food
    element. He had noticed that the children of the poor families
    were afflicted with rickets
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> and other diseases which
       could be remedied by the administration of the right amount
       of fat. He combined fresh suet and milk and called the
       product "oleomargarine." In the United States this product
       is now made of oleo oil or soft beef fat, neutral lard,
       cottonseed and other oils, churned with a small quantity of
       milk, and in the finer grades, cream is sometimes used. A
       certain proportion of butter is usually added, and the whole
       worked up with salt as in ordinary butter-making.</p>

    <p>Owing to the fears of the butter-makers that oleomargarine
    would supplant their product in popular favor, legislation was
    enacted that restricted the manufacture of oleo and established
    a rigid system of governmental inspection, so that the product
    is now manufactured under the most sanitary conditions which
    furnishes a cleaner and more reliable product than natural
    butter.</p>

    <p>Nut margarine is a compound of cocoa oil, which so closely
    resembles butter that only an expert can distinguish it from
    the natural product. Both these butter substitutes are used in
    large amounts by the best bakers, confectioners and biscuit
    manufacturers, and foolish prejudice against butter substitutes
    should not deter their use in the home.</p>

    <p>A large saving in cooking fats can be made by the careful
    utilization of all fats that come into the home. Beef and
    mutton suet can be rendered and made available. Fats which have
    been saved after meals are cooked should be clarified&mdash;that
    is, freed from all objectionable odors, tastes or color&mdash;so
    as to be made available as shortening and frying fats.</p>

    <p>The following recipes and suggestions make possible the use
    of all fats, and as fat shortage is one of the most serious of
    the world's food problems, it is essential that every
    housekeeper have a larger knowledge of the utilization and
    economy of this essential
    food.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"

    <h3>TO RENDER FATS</h3>

    <h4>TO RENDER FAT BY DIRECT METHOD</h4>

    <p>Run the fat through the household meat grinder or chop fine
    in the chopping bowl. Then heat in the double boiler until
    completely melted, finally straining through a rather thick
    cloth or two thicknesses of cheese cloth, wrung out in hot
    water. By this method there is no danger of scorching. Fats
    heated at a low temperature also keep better than those melted
    at higher temperature. After the fat is rendered, it should be
    slowly reheated to sterilize it and make sure it is free from
    moisture. The bits of tissue strained out, commonly known as
    cracklings, may be used for shortening purposes or may be added
    to cornmeal which is to be used as fried cornmeal mush.</p>

    <h4>TO RENDER FAT WITH MILK</h4>

    <p>To two pounds of fat (finely chopped if unrendered) add
    one-half pint of milk, preferably sour. Heat the mixture in a
    double boiler until thoroughly melted. Stir well and strain
    through a thick cloth or two thicknesses of cheese cloth wrung
    out in hot water. When cold the fat forms a hard, clean layer
    and any material adhering to the under side of the fat, may be
    scraped off. Sour milk being coagulated
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> is preferable to sweet milk
       since the curd remains on the cloth through which the
       rendered mixture is strained and is thus more easily
       separated from the rendered fat which has acquired some of
       the milk flavor and butter fat.</p>

    <h4>TO RENDER FAT BY COLD WATER METHOD</h4>

    <p>Cut fat in small pieces. Cover with cold water. Heat slowly.
    Let cook until bubbling ceases. Press fat during heating so as
    to obtain all the oil possible. When boiling ceases strain
    through cheesecloth and let harden. If desired one-half
    teaspoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon onion and
    1 teaspoon poultry seasoning may be added before straining.</p>

    <h4>TO RENDER STRONG FLAVORED FATS</h4>

    <p>To mutton, duck or goose fat add equal amount of beef suet
    or vegetable fat and render same as suet. This may then be used
    for shortening, or pan broiling for meat or fish dishes, and
    not have the characteristic taste of the stronger fats.</p>

    <p>When rendering strong mutton, duck or goose fats if a small
    whole onion is added the strong flavor of the fat is reduced.
    Remove the onion before straining. It may be used in
    cooking.</p>

    <h4>TO CLARIFY FAT</h4>

    <p>Melt the fat in an equal volume of water and heat for a
    short time at a moderate temperature. Stir occasionally. Cool
    and remove the layer of fat which forms on the top, scraping
    off any bits of meat or other material which may adhere to the
    other side.</p>

    <p>Fats which have formed on top of soups, of cooked meats
    (such as pot roast, stews), salt meats (such as corned beef,
    ham, etc.), or strong fats, such as from boiled mutton, poultry
    and game, may be clarified in this way and used alone or
    combined with other animal or vegetable fats in any savory
    dish.</p>

    <h4>CARE OF FAT AFTER BEING USED FOR COOKING</h4>

    <p>If fat is used for deep fat frying as croquettes, doughnuts,
    fritters, etc., while fat is still hot, add a few slices raw
    potato and allow it to stay in the fat until it is cool. Remove
    potato&mdash;strain fat, allow to harden and it is ready to
    use. The potato absorbs odors from fat.</p>

    <h4>HOW TO MAKE SAVORY FATS</h4>

    <p>FAT 1: To 1 pound of unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1
    slice of onion about one-half inch thick and two inches in
    diameter, 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoonful salt, and about one-eighth
    teaspoonful of pepper. Render in a double boiler and
    strain.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>

    <p>FAT 2: To 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 2
    teaspoonfuls of thyme, 1 slice onion, about one-half inch thick
    and two inches in diameter, one teaspoonful salt and about
    one-eighth teaspoonful pepper. Render in a double boiler and
    strain.</p>

    <p>FAT 3: To 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1
    teaspoonful thyme, 1 teaspoonful marjoram, one-half teaspoonful
    rubbed sage, 1 teaspoonful salt, and about one-eighth
    teaspoonful pepper. Render in a double boiler and strain
    through fine cloth.</p>

    <h4>EXTENSION OF TABLE FATS</h4>

    <p>A. Butter or other fat may be extended to double its
    original bulk and reduce the cost of the fat 40 per cent. A
    patented churn, any homemade churn, mayonnaise mixer, or bowl
    and rotary beater may be used for the purpose. To any quantity
    of butter heated until slightly soft add equal quantity of
    milk, place in the churn, add one teaspoon salt for each one
    pound of butter used. Blend thoroughly in churn, mayonnaise
    mixer, or in bowl with rotary beater until of even consistency.
    Place in refrigerator to harden. Vegetable coloring, such as
    comes with margarine or may be purchased separately, may be
    added if a deeper yellow color is desired.</p>

    <h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR PASTRY</h3>

    <p>Whole wheat makes a more tasty crust than bread flour and
    all rye pastry has even better flavor than wheat flour pastry.
    Half wheat or rye and the other half cornmeal (white or yellow)
    makes an excellent pastry for meat or fish pie. If cornmeal is
    added, use this recipe:</p>

    <h3>PASTRY MADE WITH DRIPPING</h3>

    <p>Well made, digestible pastry should have a minimum of fat to
    make a crisp flaky crust. It should be crisp, not brittle;
    firm, not crumbly. Pastry may be made in large amounts, kept in
    refrigerator for several days and used as needed. Roll out only
    enough for one crust at a time as the less pastry is handled,
    the better.</p>

    <h2>SAVE FOOD</h2>

    <h4><i>Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us Not to Waste Food,
    with Practical Recipes on the Use of Leftovers</i></h4>

    <p>Elimination of food waste is to-day a patriotic service. It
    is also a most effective method of solving our food problem.
    This country, like all the powers at war, will undoubtedly be
    called upon to face increasing prices so long as the war
    continues, and waste in any form is not only needless
    squandering of the family income, but failure in devotion to a
    great cause.</p>

    <p>Food waste is due to poor selection of raw materials, to
    careless storage and heedless preparation, to bad cooking, to
    injudicious serving, and to the overflowing garbage pail.</p>

    <p>To select food in such a way as will eliminate waste and at
    the same time insure the best possible return for money spent,
    the housekeeper must purchase for nutriment rather than to
    please her own or the family palate.</p>

    <p>When eggs are sixty and seventy cents a dozen their price is
    out of all proportion to their food value. Tomatoes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> at five or ten cents apiece
       in winter do not supply sufficient nutriment to warrant
       their cost, nor does capon at forty-five cents a pound
       nourish the body any better than the fricassee fowl at
       twenty-eight cents. In order to prevent such costly
       purchasing, a knowledge of food values is necessary. The
       simplest and easiest way to plan food values is to divide
       the common food materials into five main groups and see that
       each of these groups appear in each day's menu.</p>

    <h4>GROUP 1.&mdash;Foods depended on for mineral matters,
    vegetable acids, and body-regulating substances.</h4>

    <h4>FRUITS</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Apples, pears, etc.,</p>

            <p>Berries,</p>

            <p>Melons,</p>

            <p>Oranges, lemons, all citrus fruits.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>VEGETABLES</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Salads, lettuce, celery,</p>

            <p>Potherbs or "greens"</p>

            <p>Tomatoes, squash,</p>

            <p>Green peas, green beans,</p>

            <p>Potatoes and root vegetables.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>GROUP 2.&mdash;Foods depended on for protein.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Milk, skim milk, cheese,</p>

            <p>Eggs,</p>

            <p>Meat,</p>

            <p>Poultry,</p>

            <p>Fish,</p>

            <p>Dried peas, beans, cow-peas,</p>

            <p>Nuts.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>GROUP 3.&mdash;Foods depended on for starch.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Cereals, grains, meals, flour,</p>

            <p>Cereal breakfast foods,</p>

        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>

    <h4>GROUP 4.&mdash;Foods depended on for sugar.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Sugar,</p>

            <p>Molasses,</p>

            <p>Syrups,</p>

            <p>Dates,</p>

            <p>Raisins,</p>

            <p>Figs.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>GROUP 5.&mdash;Foods depended on for fat.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Butter and cream,</p>

            <p>Lard, suet,</p>

            <p>Salt pork and bacon,</p>

            <p>Table and salad oils,</p>

            <p>Vegetable, nut, and commercial cooking fats and
            oils.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>If from each of these groups the housekeeper, when buying,
    chooses the lowest-cost food, she will provide the necessary
    nutriment for the least expenditure of money. In war time such
    marketing is essential.</p>

    <p>Other causes of waste in food purchasing may be enumerated
    as follows: Ordering by telephone. This permits the butcher or
    grocer, who has no time to make selection of foods, to send
    what comes ready to hand; whereas if the housekeeper did her
    own selecting, she could take advantage of special prices or
    "leaders"&mdash;food sold at cost or nearly cost to attract
    patronage.</p>

    <p>Buying out-of-season foods also makes marketing costly.
    Through lack of knowledge concerning the periods at which
    certain fruits and vegetables are seasonable, and therefore
    cheaper and in best flavor, housekeepers frequently pay
    exorbitant prices for poor flavored, inferior products.</p>

    <p>Buying in localities where high rental and neighborhood
    standards compel the shopkeeper to charge high prices, the
    consumer pays not only for the rent and the plate glass
    windows, but for display of out-of-season delicacies, game and
    luxury-foods. Markets should be selected where food in season
    is sold; where cleanliness and careful attention prevail rather
    than showy display.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>

    <p>Many a dollar is foolishly spent for delicatessen foods. The
    retail cost of ready prepared foods includes a fraction of the
    salary of the cook and the fuel, as well as the regular
    percentage of profit. The food, also, is not so nourishing or
    flavorsome as if freshly cooked in the home kitchen.</p>

    <p>Buying perishable foods in larger quantities than can be
    used immediately. Too frequently meats, fish, eggs, vegetables,
    milk and cream are purchased in quantities larger than needed
    for immediate consumption, and lack of knowledge of use of
    left-overs causes what is not eaten to be discarded.</p>

    <p>Buying non-perishable foods in small quantities instead of
    in bulk. Food costs on an average 50 to 75 per cent. more when
    purchased in small quantities. Select a grocer who keeps his
    goods in sanitary condition and who will sell in bulk; then do
    your purchasing from him on a large scale and extend the
    sanitary care to your own storeroom.</p>

    <p>Buying foods high in price but low in food value. Asparagus,
    canned or fresh, is not as nourishing, for instance, as canned
    corn or beans. Strawberries out of season do not compare with
    dates, figs or raisins which are to be had at all times.</p>

    <p>Buying without planning menus. By this carelessness foods
    are often purchased which do not combine well, and therefore do
    not appeal to the appetite, and so are wasted. Unplanned meals
    also lead to an unconscious extravagance in buying and an
    unnecessary accumulation of left-overs.</p>

    <p>Buying foreign brands when domestic brands are cheaper and
    often better.</p>

    <p>Leaving the trimmings from meats and poultry at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> butcher's. Bring these home
       and fry out the fatty portions for dripping; use all other
       parts for the stock pot.</p>

    <p>Having purchased for nutriment and in sufficiently large
    quantities to secure bulk rates, careful storage is the next
    step in the prevention of waste. Flour, cereals and meals
    become wormy if they are not kept in clean, covered utensils
    and in a cool place. Milk becomes sour, especially in summer.
    This can be prevented by scalding it as soon as received,
    cooling quickly, and storing in a cold place in covered,
    well-scalded receptacles. Sour milk should not be thrown out.
    It is good in biscuits, gingerbread, salad dressings, cottage
    cheese, pancakes or waffles, and bread making.</p>

    <p>Meats should not be left in their wrappings. Much juice
    soaks into the paper, which causes a loss of flavor and
    nutriment. Store all meat in a cool place and do not let flies
    come in contact with it.</p>

    <p>Bread often molds, especially in warm, moist weather. Trim
    off moldy spots and heat through. Keep the bread box sweet by
    scalding and sunning once a week.</p>

    <p>Cheese molds. Keep in a cool, dry place. If it becomes too
    dry for table use, grate for sauces or use in scalloped
    dishes.</p>

    <p>Winter vegetables wilt and dry out. Store in a cool place.
    If cellar space permits, place in box of sand, sawdust or
    garden earth.</p>

    <p>Potatoes and onions sprout. Cut off the sprouts as soon as
    they appear and use for soup. Soak, before using, vegetables
    which have sprouted.</p>

    <p>Fruits must be stored carefully so as to keep the skins
    unbroken. Broken spots in the skin cause rapid decay. Do not
    permit good fruit to remain in contact with specked or rotted
    fruit. Stored fruit should be looked over frequently and all
    specked or rotted fruit removed.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> Sweet potatoes are an
       exception. Picking over, aggravates the trouble. See that
       these vegetables are carefully handled at all times; if rot
       develops, remove only those that can be reached without
       danger of bruising the sound roots. Sweet potatoes may also
       be stored like fruit by spreading over a large surface and
       separating the tubers so that they do not touch each
       other.</p>

    <p>Berries should be picked over as soon as received and spread
    on a platter or a large surface to prevent crushing and to
    allow room for circulation of air.</p>

    <p>Lettuce and greens wilt. Wash carefully as soon as received
    and use the coarse leaves for soup. Shake the water from the
    crisp portions and store in a paper bag in a cold
    refrigerator.</p>

    <p>Lemons when cut often grow moldy before they are used. When
    lemons are spoiling, squeeze out the juice, make a syrup of one
    cup of sugar and one cup of water, boil ten minutes and add
    lemon juice in any amount up to one cup. Bring to boiling point
    and bottle for future use. This bottled juice may be used for
    puddings, beverages, etc. If only a small amount of juice is
    needed, prick one end of a lemon with a fork. Squeeze out the
    amount needed and store the lemon in the ice-box.</p>

    <p>When we come to waste caused by careless preparation we may
    be reminded of the miracle of the loaves and fishes&mdash;how
    all the guests were fed and then twelve baskets were gathered
    up. Often after preparation that which is gathered up to be
    thrown away is as large in quantity and as high in food value
    as the portions used.</p>

    <p>Vegetables are wasted in preparation by too thick paring,
    the discarding of coarse leaves such as are found on lettuce,
    cabbage and cauliflower, discarding wilted parts which can be
    saved by soaking, throwing away tips and roots of celery and
    the roots and ends of spinach and dandelions. All these waste
    products can be cooked <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> tender, rubbed through a
       sieve and used with stock for vegetable soup, or with
       skimmed milk for cream soup. Such products are being
       conserved by the enemy, even to the onion skin, which is
       ground into bread-making material.</p>

    <p>Throwing away the water in which vegetables have been cooked
    wastes their characteristic and valuable element&mdash;the
    mineral salts. Cooking them so much that they become watery;
    under-cooking so that they are hard and indigestible; cooking
    more than is required for a meal; failing to use left-over
    portions promptly as an entree or for cream soups or scalloped
    dishes&mdash;all these things mean an appalling waste of
    valuable food material. Good food material is also lost when
    the water in which rice or macaroni or other starchy food has
    been boiled is poured down the kitchen sink. Such water should
    be used for soup making.</p>

    <p>Fruits are wasted by throwing away the cores and skins,
    which can be used for making sauces, jams and jellies, the
    latter being sweetened with corn syrup instead of sugar.</p>

    <p>Rhubarb is wasted by removing the pink skin from young
    rhubarb, which should be retained to add flavor and
    color-attractiveness to the dish.</p>

    <p>Raw food in quantity is frequently left in the mixing bowl,
    while by the use of a good flexible knife or spatula every
    particle can be saved. A large palette knife is as good in the
    kitchen as in the studio.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The next step in food preparation is cooking, and tons of
    valuable material are wasted through ignorance of the
    principles of cooking.</p>

    <p>Bad cooking, which means under-cooking, over-cooking or
    flavorless cooking, renders food inedible, and inedible food
    contributes to world shortage.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> Fats are wasted in cooking by
       being burned and by not being carefully utilized as dripping
       and shortening. The water in which salt meat, fresh meat, or
       poultry has been boiled should be allowed to cool and the
       fat removed before soup is made of it. Such fat can be used,
       first of all, in cooking, and then any inedible portions can
       be used in soap making.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Tough odds and ends of meat not sightly enough to appear on
    the table are often wasted. They can be transformed by long
    cooking into savory stews, ragouts, croquettes and hashes,
    whereas, if carelessly and insufficiently cooked, they are
    unpalatable and indigestible. Scraps of left-over cooked meat
    should be ground in the food-chopper and made into appetizing
    meat balls, hashes or sandwich paste. If you happen to have a
    soft cooked egg left over, boil it hard at once. It can be used
    for garnishes, sauces, salads or sandwich paste.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Use all bits of bread, that cannot be used as toast, in
    puddings, croquettes, scalloped dishes or to thicken soup.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Don't throw away cold muffins and fancy breads. Split and
    toast them for next day's breakfast.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Foods that survive the earlier forms of waste are often lost
    at table by the serving of portions of like size to all members
    of the family. The individual food requirements differ
    according to age, sex, vocation and state of health. Each
    should be considered before the food is served, then there will
    be no waste on the plates when the meal is over. The following
    table, showing the daily requirement of calories for men and
    women in various lines of work, illustrates this
    point:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

            <p>Sedentary work ... 2,400</p>

            <p>Active work ... 2,700</p>

            <p>Hard manual labor ... 3,200</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>MEN CALORIES</p>

            <p>Sedentary work ... 2,700</p>

            <p>Active work ... 3,450</p>

            <p>Hard manual labor ... 4,150</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Although the serving of food should be carefully planned so
    as to prevent waste, care should be taken that growing children
    have ample food. It is a mistake to suppose that a growing
    child can be nourished on less than a sedentary adult. A boy of
    fourteen who wants to eat more than his father probably needs
    all that he asks for. We must not save on the children; but it
    will be well to give them plain food for the most part, which
    will not tempt them to overeat, and tactfully combat
    pernickety, overfastidious likes and dislikes.</p>

    <p>The United States Food Administration is preaching the
    gospel of the clean plate, and this can be accomplished by
    serving smaller portions, insisting that all food accepted be
    eaten; by keeping down bread waste, cutting the bread at the
    table a slice at a time as needed; by cooking only sufficient
    to supply moderately the number to be fed, and no more. It is a
    false idea of good providing that platters must leave the table
    with a generous left-over. Waste of cooked food is a serious
    item in household economy, and no matter how skillfully
    leftovers are utilized, it is always less expensive and more
    appetizing to provide fresh-cooked foods at each meal.</p>

    <p>One would think that with the various uses to which all
    kinds of foodstuffs may be put that there would be little left
    for the yawning garbage pail. But the Secretary of the United
    States Department of Agriculture is responsible for the
    statement that $750,000,000 worth of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> food has been wasted annually
       in the American kitchen. Undoubtedly a large part of this
       wastefulness was due to ignorance on the part of the
       housewife, and the rest of it to the lack of co-operation on
       the part of the employees who have handled the food but not
       paid the bills.</p>

    <p>According to a well-known domestic scientist, the only
    things which should find their way to the garbage pail are:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Egg shells&mdash;after being used to clear
            coffee.</p>

            <p>Potato skins&mdash;after having been cooked on the
            potato.</p>

            <p>Banana skins&mdash;if there are no tan shoes to be
            cleaned.</p>

            <p>Bones&mdash;after having been boiled in soup
            kettle.</p>

            <p>Coffee grounds&mdash;if there is no garden where
            they can be used for fertilizer, or if they are not
            desired as filling for pincushions.</p>

            <p>Tea leaves&mdash;after every tea-serving, if they
            are not needed for brightening carpets or rugs when
            swept.</p>

            <p>Asparagus ends&mdash;after being cooked and drained
            for soup.</p>

            <p>Spinach, etc.&mdash;decayed leaves and dirty ends of
            roots.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>If more than this is now thrown away, you are wasting the
    family income and not fulfilling your part in the great world
    struggle. Your government says that it is your business to know
    what food your family needs to be efficient; that you must
    learn how to make the most of the foods you buy; that it is
    your duty to learn the nature and uses of various foods and to
    get the greatest possible nourishment out of every pound of
    food that comes to your home.</p>

    <p>The art of utilizing left-overs is an important factor in
    this prevention of waste. The thrifty have always known it. The
    careless have always ignored it. But now as a measure of home
    economy as well as a patriotic service, the left-over must be
    handled intelligently.</p>

    <p>The following recipes show how to make appetizing dishes
    from products that heretofore in many homes have found their
    way to the extravagant
    pail.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>

    <p>In these recipes, sauces are prominent because they are of
    great value in making foods of neutral flavor, especially the
    starchy winter vegetables, and rice, macaroni and hominy, as
    attractive as they are nutritious; salads are included, since
    these serve to combine odds and ends of meats and vegetables;
    gelatine dishes are provided because gelatine serves as a
    binder for all kinds of leftovers and is an extremely practical
    way of making the most rigid saving acceptable; desserts made
    of crumbs of bread and cake, or left-over cereals, are among
    the major economies if they are worked out in such a way that
    they do not involve the extravagant use of other foodstuffs.
    All the recipes in this economy cook-book have been
    thoughtfully adapted to the conditions of the time, and will
    show the practical housekeeper how to supply wholesome,
    flavorsome food for the least cost.</p>

    <h3>SOUPS UTILIZE LEFTOVERS</h3>

    <p>In nearly every case when meat is purchased, some bone is
    paid for. Too frequently this is either left at the market or
    thrown away in the home. Bones, gristle, tough ends, head and
    feet of chickens, head, fins and bones of fish, etc., should be
    utilized for making soup.</p>

    <p>If a meat or fish chowder with plenty of vegetable
    accompaniment is served, no other meat is required for the
    usual home meal.</p>

    <p>If a cream of dried or fresh vegetables, or a meat stock
    soup with plenty of vegetables or cereal content, is served,
    the amount of meat eaten with the main course of the meal will
    be materially lessened.</p>

    <p>Soups may be a most economical method of using water in
    which meat, fish or vegetables have been cooked; also of
    utilizing small portions of leftover meats, fish, vegetables or
    cereal.</p>

    <p>Cream soups are made by cooking vegetables or cereal, then
    utilizing the water in which they are cooked as part of the
    liquid for the soup. Outer parts or wilted parts of vegetables
    may be utilized for soups instead of being discarded. Water in
    which ham or mutton has been boiled makes an excellent basis
    for dried or fresh vegetable soups. In fact, soup can be made
    from all kinds of leftovers&mdash;the variety and kind make
    little difference so long as the mixture is allowed to simmer
    for several hours and is properly seasoned.</p>

    <p>To each 1 lb. of meat and bone, add 1 qt. cold water. Let
    stand 1 hour. Cover and bring slowly to boiling point and
    simmer 2 to 3 hours. Remove bones and meat. Let stand until
    cold. Skim off fat. Add vegetables cut in small pieces, season
    as desired and cook until vegetables are tender. Leftover
    cereals, as barley, oatmeal, etc., vegetables, macaroni,
    tapioca, sago, etc., etc., may be added for increased food
    value.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"

    <h3>SAVE AND SERVE</h3>

    <p><u>TO SAVE BREAD.</u> Serve bread or rolls made from corn,
    rye or from coarse flours. Use breakfast foods and hot cakes,
    composed of corn, oatmeal, buckwheat, rice or hominy. Serve no
    toast as garniture or under meat. Serve war breads. Use every
    part of the bread, either fresh or stale, for puddings and
    toast; or dried and sifted for baked croquettes; or use to
    extend flour in the making of muffins and drop cakes.</p>

    <p><u>TO SAVE MEAT.</u> Use more chicken, hare, rabbits, duck,
    goose, lobster, oysters, clams and egg and cheese dishes of all
    kinds. Use less beef, mutton, and pork and serve smaller
    portions at table of these meats. Have fewer of these items on
    the menu. Provide more entrees and made-over dishes in which a
    smaller quantity of meat is extended by the use of potatoes,
    rice, hominy, etc. Use beans, as they contain nearly the same
    nutritive value as meat. Serve bacon only as a dish and not as
    a garniture, and this way not more than once a week. Use
    cheese, dried vegetables and nuts. Use fish and meat chowders.
    Use meat extension dishes. Serve vegetable dinners.</p>

    <p><u>TO SAVE SUGAR.</u> Use less candy and sweet drinks. Use
    honey, maple sugar, corn syrup, molasses and dark syrups with
    hot cakes and waffles and in all cooking, in order to save
    butter and sugar. Use all classes of fruit preserves, jam,
    marmalades and jellies. Do not frost or ice cakes. Serve dried
    fruits with cereals, and no sugar is
    needed.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>

    <p><u>TO SAVE FATS.</u> Serve as few fried dishes as possible,
    so as to save both butter and lard, and in any event use
    vegetable oils for frying&mdash;that is, olive oil, corn oil,
    cottonseed oil, vegetable oil compounds, etc. Trim all coarse
    fats from meats before cooking and use the waste fats for
    shortening and for soap. We are short of soap fats as our
    supplies of tropical oils used for soap-making are reduced. Do
    not waste soap. Save fat from soup stock and from boiled meats.
    Use butter substitutes where possible.</p>

    <p><u>TO SAVE MILK.</u> Use it all. Buy whole milk and let
    cream rise. Use this cream, and you secure your milk without
    cost. Economize on milk and cream except for children. Serve
    buttermilk. Serve cottage cheese regularly in varying forms. It
    is especially nutritious. Use skimmed milk in cooking. A great
    quantity of it goes to waste in this country. Use cheese
    generally. The children must have milk whole, therefore reduce
    the use of cream.</p>

    <p><u>USE VEGETABLES.</u> Use more vegetables and potatoes.
    Make fruits and vegetables into salads and attractive dishes.
    Feature vegetable dinners and salads of all kinds. Encourage
    the use of cheese with salads. Make all types of salads from
    vegetables. We have a great surplus of vegetables, and they can
    be used by substituting them for staples so that the staples
    most needed will be saved.</p>

    <p>Make all kinds of vegetable soups, especially the cream
    soups, in which the waste from staple vegetables, such as outer
    leaves and wilted parts, can be utilized. These are wholesome
    and nutritious and save
    meat.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
